<h3>About</h3>
<p>rpg the rpg: an mmorpg is a manual monoplayer online role-playing
game that started out as an assignment in my Computer Engineering class. 
I had to turn it in when it was due, but I was far from done with it.
I realized it had a lot of potential, so I decided to take it further. 
However, for the things I wanted to do with it, C wasn't
the right language for it. I decided on creating a web page
to play the game on, while simultaneously developing my skill
in markup and web-based languages. That led to a poorly-designed
MS-DOS throwback. I'm a programmer, not a graphic designer. Deal
with it. Simplicity is nice. You've got a problem with that? Okay,
show me how your site works. What? You don't have one? Then shut up
and either play my game or leave. May I suggest the former? It's
actually kinda fun once you start playing. A lot more fun than 
reading this. Unless you like playing games like Wall of Text:
The Game. Does that even exist? It should. Because you're playing
it right now.</p>
